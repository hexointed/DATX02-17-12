How well does our hardware accomodate the sphere tracing algorithm?
What possible optimizations are there?

Currently a bit negative in the rusult, we only need to talk about time 
constraints in scope and discussion.

All the initial questions from the planning report don't really need to be 
completed, as they are not a part of the grading criteria.

Move the unimplemented optimizations from Results to Discussion.

6.2 GPU Performance doesn't contain any results

The headings in Results should match the statements in Goals

Add a paragraph to the beginning of Discussion, before 7.1.
Disscuss 'future work', stuff we didn't hav time to do in discussion

Conclusions: Questions here? It's nice to have these questions referencing the 
rest of the report but we don't want this chapter to be too desparate.

Conclusions 
	reiterate future work that can be done
	six subsections seems a bit much
	shouldn't contain any new information

Abstract
	Avoid references
	no table of contents

Instruction listings in appendix: probably a good idea
assembly language: should probably be in report, mentioned in results and in 
appendix

state of the art? Theory? Implementation? clarify. what is the main focus?
