		\subsection{\clash}

			For this project \clash was chosen as hardware description language.
			\clash is based on the functional programming language Haskell, and
			is relatively new and not yet fully stable. It differs from 
			traditional hardware description languages in that 

			One thing that \clash offers that proved to be very useful is the 
			avalability of a command-line repl. This improved testing and 
			debugging possibilities significantly, and was very useful in order
			to be able to quickly write and test new modules.

		\subsection{Hardware design}

			Many design decisions during the development of the gpu were not
			thoroughly researched or performance tested against possible
			alternatives. It is clear that doing so would have been desirable,
			both in order to improve performance of the resulting design and to
			get a better understanding of the possible design space. 
			Unfortunately, proper performance evaluation for all design 
			decisions would be very time consuming, and there was not enough 
			time for this during this project.
