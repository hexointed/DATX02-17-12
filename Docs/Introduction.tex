	\section{Background}
	
	\section{Project goals}
		
		The main goal for this project was to design and implement a basic
		graphics processor unit (GPU) architecture that is with is designed to
		be able to accomodate the ray-marching algorithm well. In addition to
		this, an aim was to look at possible optimizations, both algorithmic
		and hardware based, for the ray-marching algorithm.
		
	\section{Scope}
		
		The scope of the project was threefold. First to research the algorithm and
		the improvements that already exists, design a rudimentary GPU and
		finally to improve upon the design based upon what we assessed and figured
		out from the research.

		Each of these steps could span an entire bachelors thesis, so in this 
		project we instead did them on a best-effort basis as a compromise.
		When designing the GPU we also prioritized implementing the parts unique to the
		problem before things that all GPUs eventually need such as an advanced 
		memory and cache architecture etc.
