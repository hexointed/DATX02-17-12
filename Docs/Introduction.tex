	\section{Project goals}
		
		The main goal for this project was to design and implement a basic
		graphics processor unit (GPU) architecture that is with is designed to
		be able to accomodate the ray-marching algorithm well. In addition to
		this, an aim was to took at possible optimizations, both algorithmic
		and hardware based, for the ray-marching algorithm.
