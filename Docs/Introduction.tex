	\section{Background}
		During the early 90’s many types of real time rendering algorithms were 
		developed and used. This was possible because they all ran in software 
		on the main computer processor, and could thus be easily altered and 
		enhanced. Photorealistic rendering could be done using a method called 
		Ray Tracing, but this was very slow. Improvements were made to this 
		method and one such sub-algorithm was called Sphere Tracing. It proved
		useful for Ray Tracing 3D fractals, but it was still too slow to render
		any type of geometry in real time. Better graphics rendering (fast 
		real time graphics) was a key selling point among competing computer 
		systems, so to improve rendering speed, the computer industry moved 
		towards dedicated hardware based graphics rendering. These systems were
		almost exclusively using polygon-based rendering, and most Ray Tracing 
		algorithms can not be rendered this way. Today, 3D graphics cards have 
		become more programmable and the last 5 years have seen a small 
		resurgence in the use of Sphere Tracing	rendering. Simple scenes can 
		now be rendered, using sphere tracing, in real time using a state of 
		the art consumer 3D graphics card. This has a whole new set of pros 
		and cons when compared to polygon rendering. However, while 
		the algorithm seems to have a lot of potential for future 3D graphics, 
		that potential might be unreachable on current GPUs (Graphics 
		Processing Unit) due to the underlying architecture being designed for 
		polygon rendering. This project will examine ideas for what could be 
		achieved if graphics cards were optimized and built specifically for 
		Sphere Tracing Graphics	instead of today’s polygon based hardware.		 
	
	\section{Project goals}

		The main goal for this project was to design and implement a basic GPU 
		architecture that is designed to be able to accommodate the Sphere 
		Tracing algorithm. In addition, another aim was to look at possible 
		optimizations, both algorithmic	and hardware based, for this algorithm.
		
	\section{Scope}
		
		The scope of the project was threefold. First to research the algorithm
		and the improvements that already exist, secondly design a rudimentary 
		GPU and	finally to improve upon the design based upon what we assessed 
		and	figured out from the research.

		Each of these parts could span an entire bachelors thesis on their own, 
		so in this project we instead did them on a best-effort basis as a 
		compromise.	When designing the GPU decisions were made only implement 
		the parts unique to the task and thus skipping some general parts such 
		as an advanced memory and cache architecture.
