\chapter{Results}

	Here are different improvements of the GPU that's been implemented and tested.
	Also hypothetical improvements that has only been discussed and not
	implemented.

	\section{Software Shader Performance}

	\section{GPU Performance}
		
		It is important to note that almost no effort was spent trying to
		optimize the performance of our design.

	\section{Optimizations}
		
		During this project, a number of optimizations were discussed and 
		developed, the developed are explained here and the theoretical ones
		are brought up in the discussion section. Some of these are based on earlier
		work, with some others we believe are quite different from optimizations
		that have been discussed for sphere tracing previously.

		\subsection{Orthogonal culling}
			Orthogonal culling was implemented in the software shader and increased 
			the performance.
