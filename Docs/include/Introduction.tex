\chapter{Introduction}
The primary goal of the project is a ray-marching graphics card proof-of-concept that 
hopefully will look promising enough to warrant further work in making a ray-marching based 
graphics card. If the results show that there is more performance potential in ray-marching 
than in the current industryâ€™s approach, then that could become a link from the theory of 
ray-marching to the practice of hardware-accelerated ray-marching. This would be useful in 
order to more accurately estimate what kind of performance you could expect if the current 
industry focused on ray-marching instead of polygon based graphics.
