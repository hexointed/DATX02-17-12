\chapter{Problem Description}

The main problem is to identify the critical parts of the algorithm that
prevents it from being a feasible alternative today, and to figure out a proper
hardware design that accelerate those parts. Following are the questions we
worked to answer throughout the project.

\begin{itemize}
	\item	How does sphere tracing work?
	\item What language should we use to describe the GPU?
	\item Are there ways we can improve the algorithm at a theoretical level?
	\item How do we architect for parrallelism and multiple cores?
	\item How do we handle cache in a smart way?
	\item What mathematical functions are best implemented in hardware vs software regarding?

\end{itemize}
