\chapter{Problem Description}

	The main problem is to identify the critical parts of the algorithm that
	prevents it from being a feasible alternative today, and to figure out a
	 hardware design that improves the performance of those parts. Following are the
	questions we worked to answer throughout the project.
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item How does sphere tracing work?
		\item What language is best suited to describe the GPU?
		\item Are there ways we can improve the algorithm at a theoretical 
			level?
		\item How do we architect for parallelism and multiple cores?
		\item How do we handle cache in a smart way?
		\item What mathematical functions are best implemented in hardware vs 
			software?
	\end{itemize}
