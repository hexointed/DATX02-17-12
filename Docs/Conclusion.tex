\chapter{Conclusion} 

The two FHDLs, lava2000 and \clash, not being fully developed languages both
produced obtuse and redundant code and in the case of \clash even
unsynthezisable code (bug). In the end we decided to go with \clash and it did
allow us to type less and to have a more clear overview of the GPU and its
components.
