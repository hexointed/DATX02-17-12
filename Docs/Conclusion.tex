\chapter{Conclusions}

	The goal of the project was to design and create a GPU and then to optimize
	it and the Sphere Tracing algoritm it was built for. A working GPU was
	written together with a Sphere Tracing shader programmed separately,
	running on the GPU. A similar reference shader was also written in GLSL. On
	the GLSL shader we tried two optimizations, Bounding Sphere and Orthogonal
	Culling. Both improved the performance but only by one order of magnitude.
	They can still be further improved by expanding the shader to an engine
	where parts of the computation would be offloaded on the CPU. 
	
	For the hardware optimization we explored ways of speeding up the square
	root. We found a number of fast solutions that are all bounded in the
	relative error. The GPU executes as intended and, if programmed correctly,
	can Sphere Trace complete scenes. 
	
	It has been an involving project for all of the group members and we have
	had to read up on a lot of different subjects in tandem. Not only learning
	about building hardware and optimizing algorithms, we have also learnt the
	importance of earlier-than-you-think prototyping and keeping all members of
	a project busy. Much like you want to keep all components of your hardware
	as busy as possible.
