\chapter{Conclusions}

The intent of the project was to design and create a GPU aswell as experiment
with some optimizations around the subject. Though taking three times as long
to write as intended, a working GPU was written together with a Sphere Tracing
shader programmed for it. A similar reference shader was also written in GLSL.
