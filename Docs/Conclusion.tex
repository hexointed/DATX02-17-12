\chapter{Conclusions}

The intent of the project was to design and create a GPU aswell as experiment
with some optimizations around the subject. Though taking three times as long
to write as intended, a working GPU was written together with a Sphere Tracing
shader separately programmed, running on the GPU. A similar reference shader
was also written in GLSL. On the GLSL shader we tried two optimizations named
Bounding Spheres and Orthogonal Culling. Both improved the performance but only
one order of magnitude on an already low scale. They can still be further
improved by expanding the shader to an engine where parts of the computation
would be offloaded on the CPU. For the hardware we looked at different ways of
speeding up the square root which is one of the operations that bottelnecks the
clockspeed of the GPU. A tenfold increase in clockspeed was achieved compared
to the default square root operator provided by \clash. The GPU performs
correctly and if programmed well can Sphere Trace complete scenes. This was a
well performed first step on the iterative process towards a fully realized
alternative graphics card.
