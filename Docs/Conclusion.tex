	\section{How does sphere tracing work?}

	\section{What language is best suited to describe the GPU?}
	
	The two FHDLs, lava2000 and \clash, not being fully developed languages both produced obtuse and redundant code and in the case of \clash even unsynthezisable code (bug). In the end we decided to go with \clash and it did allow us to type less and to have a more clear overview of the GPU and its components.

	\section{Are there ways we can improve the algorithm at a theoretical level?}



	\section{How do we architect for parallelism and multiple cores?}

	\section{How do we handle cache in a smart way?}

	\section{What mathematical functions are best implemented in hardware vs software regarding?}
