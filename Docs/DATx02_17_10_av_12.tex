\section*{Introduction}
	
	This is an opposition report on ``Virtual Generation of Lidar Data for
	Autonomous Vehicles‘‘, where we provide feedback and suggestions for the
	content and structure of the report. Our comments are ordered by chapter in
	the original report. An appendix with more specific comments, including
	typos and gramatical errors has been included to aid the authors.

\section*{Abstract}

	The abstract is concise and reprasentative for the project.

\section*{Introduction}

	The beginning of the introduction gets the reader up to speed and explains
	why the thesis is relevant. All references except [4] either says something
	conflicting to the text or just not supports the text and as such needs
	some more scrutinization. 1.1 express what you intend to do clearly but the
	second paragraph belongs to the beginning of introduction. 1.2 state what
	the overarching problem of the thesis is but does not further clarify other
	challenges. 1.3 is fine but in the last paragraph (insert jon rant).

\section*{Technical Background}

	Here the terms introduced in the previous chapter are further clarified as
	expected. 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 could maybe be merged to one section and 2.2
	could arguably be called Unity instead of Game Engine since Unity is the
	sole focus of the section. There could be a better picture in figure 2.1 to
	explain the concept of collision and the subtext in figure 2.2 is
	redundant. 2.2.3 is clear overall. 2.2.4 could be renamed to Pathfinding
	since that is the specific subject being discussed. It is a bit more rough
	put the point gets across.

\section*{Methods}

	This chapter's sections describes the methodology, requirement and the
	final choice that was made in creating the components. It sounds a bit wide
	for a "methods" section. 3.1 could become clearer by showing the math of
	the ray-casting algorithm in detail. Also, from what we could find reading
	up on Unity a bit, (elias rant on multithreading). 3.2 is fine overall but
	while the thesis uses scene in general to refer to the part that is created
	by the user, "world", "environment" and "space" is also sometimes used and
	it can get a bit confusing. The first paragraph in 3.2.2 is just a
	reiteration of 3.1. In 3.2.3 you mention that there are alternative methods
	and that there where tests to confirm decisions. Expand on this. 3.2.4 Is
	too small and seems to be out of place. It could maybe be a separate
	section in this chapter. 3.1 is good in general but 3.3.1 (elias rant). 3.4
	was quite tough to parse and might be helped by some pictures and relating
	the concepts discussed to your application in paticular.

\section*{Results}

	As with the methods chapter, the results contain a lot of information about
	the implementation of the simulator. If all this information was moved to
	the same place, it should be possible to reduce the amount of text without
	losing any information. Consider creating a Implementation/Application 
	chapter and moving all implementation information there.
