\section*{Abstract}

	This report documents the results of us taking the Sphere Tracing algorithm
	and designing a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) made to run it, using Clash, 
	a functional hardware description language .\cite{Raa2015a} The report 
	starts with an in-depth description of the algorithm Sphere Tracing. 
	Next a description of "insert and describe in short	the optimizations" 
	follows. We then go through the parts that make up the 
	bare minimum GPU followed by "insert and describe in short the hardware 
	optimizations". The analysis presented in this report is intended to give 
	a hint of what,	if anything, could be gained from an alternative approach 
	to real time rendering 3D graphics cards.
