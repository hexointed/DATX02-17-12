\section*{Abstract}

	This report documents the results of us taking the ray-marching algorithm
	and designing a GPU made to run it using a hardware descriptory language
	named Clash.\cite{Raa2015a} The report starts with an in-depth description
	of the ray-marching algorithm followed by "insert and describe in short the
	optimizations". We then go through the parts that make up the bare minimum
	GPU followed by "insert and describe in short the hardware optimizations".
	The analysis presented in this report is intended to give a hint of what,
	if anything, could be gained from an alternative approach to graphic cards.
	More work is needed before an actual prototype can be printed. An FPGA
	implementation, however, would not require too much additional work.
