\section*{Abstract}
	
	Real-time rendering speed has always been a significant factor for 3D
	graphic cards. However, 3D graphic cards today are optimized and built for
	the polygon-based rendering.  Therefore, Sphere Tracing rendering is slower
	in this hardware.  The aim of this thesis is to implement and design a
	basic GPU (Graphic proccesing unit) that could execute Sphere tracing.
	Subsequent to this, some optimizations were implemented in order to further
	assess the potential performance of the Sphere Tracing algorithm.
	
	This thesis documents the result of us examining the Sphere Tracing
	algorithm and designing a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) to run it, using
	Clash, a functional hardware description language. In addition, possible
	future work are discussed.
