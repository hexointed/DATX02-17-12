Sphere Tracing:
	
	- How Sphere Tracing works.
	- Why is it interesting?

Software shader:
	
	- Very quick
	- Materials? Reflections?

Optimizations:
	
	- Describe each
	- Show with/without optimizations to show fps differance

Processor:
	
	- Architecture overview
	- Assembler

Square Roots:
	
	- Fast approximation
	- Improved approximation
	- Lerp/Babylonian
	- Shifting nth root
	- Sphere Tracing fault tolerance

Conclusion:
	
	- More work needed on GPU for more meaningful conclusions
	- Sphere Tracing has interesting properties
